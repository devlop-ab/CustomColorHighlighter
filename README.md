Custom Highlighter lets you highlight any words you wish with any color you desire, it's based on (and inspired by) [Kronuz/ColorHighlight](https://github.com/Kronuz/ColorHighlight), but instead of coming with a preconfigured set of words/patterns to highlight, Custom Highlighter comes with zero assumptions and let you configure anything you wish, as you wish.

This is **not a replacement** for _Kronuz/ColorHighlight_, but they do work great together for maximum coloring goodness.

## Installation

- **_Recommended_** - Using [Sublime Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io "Sublime Package Control")
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> then select `Package Control: Install Package`
    - install `Custom Highlighter`
- Alternatively, download the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/devlop-ab/custom-highlighter "Custom Highlighter") into your `Packages` folder and make sure to rename the directory to "Custom Highlighter".


## Usage

After installation, open up the settings (`Preferences > Package Settings > Custom Highlighter > Settings`) and configure it to fit you needs, entries are added as simple `key value` configurations, there is no regex support or wildcards when matching keywords, all keywords are matched exactly as configured.

Some examples:

Tailwind classes

```
"colors": {
  "something": "#f00",
}
```

Highlight mistakes

We all have those common spelling mistakes or accidental key presses that we keep doing, configure your most common mispelings to be highlighted for you.

```
"colors": {
  "Â ": "#f00", # MacOS non breaking space
  "retrun": "#f00", #
}
```

## Configuration

- You can disable live highlight directly from the command palette:
  `Custom Highlighter: Disable Custom Highlighter`

- Open settings using the command palette:
  `Preferences: Custom Highlighter Settings - User`

- Gutter icons can be switched among three flavors (or disabled) by using
  the `gutter_icon` setting:

  + "circle" - Gutter icon with the color in a circle
  + "square" - Gutter icon with the color in a square
  + "fill" - Fill whole gutter with color

  ```
  "gutter_icon": "fill"
  ```

- Highlighting the value region in the color can be enabled or disabled by
  using the `highlight_values` setting.
